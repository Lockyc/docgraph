# install.sh — installs/updates the docgraph binary via `go install`.
# Usage:  bash install.sh

# The curl URL requires the GitHub repo to be PUBLIC (docgraph is).

# docgraph is a Go CLI, not a bundle — this installs a BINARY to the Go bin dir; there
# is no ~/.docgraph clone to manage. It seeds the global config dir but never edits
# ~/.claude/settings.json or any repo's git hook — that guided wiring is /docgraph:install's
# job (a non-interactive curl|bash must not silently edit global config). Never uses `just`.

# major >=2 MUST declare it, or the proxy rejects every v2 tag and `@latest`
# silently falls back to the newest v1 — which is how the published install path
# broke once already. It is also the go.mod module line verbatim, so the IN_REPO
# grep below and the @latest install stay one source.
